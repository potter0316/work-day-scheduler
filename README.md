# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
I wanted to create a javascript code that enable me to create a daily planner to creat a schedule. The user will then be presented with timblocks for standard business hours. The timeblcoks willl then be color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. The user will then be able to click in the timeblock and enter an event. That event can then be saved by clicking on the save icon to the left of the timeblock. When the page is refreshed the saved events persist.

## Usage
